        <p><strong>ABOUT</strong></p>
        <p>Alexei has recently finished his Computer Science degree with Distinction. On the day of his graduation, the Dean cried upon realizing he would never see Alexei again, as the latter one had decided to travel the world and share his wisdom, following the footsteps of his mentor and close friend â€“ Buddha.</p>
        <p>The journey was spiritually enlightening and Alexei became the first person ever to achieve a state of Super-Nirvana. Along his way he never spoke a word and remained abstinent from human contact. Nevertheless, by his sheer presence, he trained numerous disciples and fathered 48 children.</p>
